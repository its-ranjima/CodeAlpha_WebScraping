# 📚 Task 1: Web Scraping – CodeAlpha Internship

## ✅ Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship** with [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/). The goal was to scrape book data from a real website using Python and BeautifulSoup.

## 🌐 Website Scraped
[books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📌 Data Extracted
- Book Title
- Price (in £)
- Star Rating

## 📂 Output
- A CSV file: `books_scraped.csv` containing scraped data
- A histogram showing the distribution of book prices

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most books are priced between **£20 and £40**
- The most common rating was **"Three" stars**

## Sample Visualization

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Loops through 5 pages of the site
2. Scrapes book data using BeautifulSoup
3. Cleans and structures it using Pandas
4. Saves the final dataset as CSV
5. Visualizes price distribution using Matplotlib
